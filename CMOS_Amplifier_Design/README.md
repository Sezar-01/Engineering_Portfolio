# CMOS Amplifier Design

## Overview
This project focuses on designing and analyzing a Class AB audio amplifier capable of driving a 16Ω load with a 1.2V power supply. The amplifier was designed to achieve over 54dB gain at 20kHz, maintain phase stability with a minimum phase margin of 55°, and limit input noise to under 100µVrms between 20Hz and 40kHz. Emphasis was placed on minimizing power consumption and occupied area.

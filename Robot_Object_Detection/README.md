# Robot Object Detection

## Overview
This project aimed to design a machine learning model for detecting and localizing objects (e.g., sample tubes) on Mars using the Sample Fetch Rover. A lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture was developed and compared with YOLOv8.

## Tools and Skills Used
- **Tools**: TensorFlow, Keras, Gradio, Python.
- **Skills**: Image preprocessing, bounding box regression, model evaluation.
